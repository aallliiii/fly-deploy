# Intelligent Search API

A sophisticated semantic search system that combines CLIP embeddings with LLM-powered query enhancement and result reranking to search through events and products data.

## What This Project Does

Imagine you have thousands of events and products in your database, and users want to search for them using natural language like "I need a summer dress for weekend events" or "outdoor music events this weekend". This API:

- **Understands Context**: Knows that "summer dress" relates to summer clothing 
- **Smart Search**: Uses AI to find the most relevant results even if the exact words don't match
- **Explains Results**: Tells you why each result was chosen and ranks them by relevance

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Uses OpenCLIP embeddings for deep semantic understanding
- **Query Enhancement**: LLM-powered query optimization with intelligent filtering
- **Result Reranking**: GPT-4 powered relevance scoring and explanation
- **Hybrid Search**: Supports both events and products with context-aware filtering
- **Time-aware Filtering**: Advanced date range filtering for events
- **Audience Targeting**: Gender-specific product recommendations

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need:
- **OpenAI API key** (for GPT-4 integration) 
- **Qdrant instance** (vector database) 

## Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Check if Python is Installed

#### On Windows:
1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter
3. If you see something like `Python 3.8.0` or higher, you're good!
4. If you get an error, go to **Step 2**

#### On Mac:
1. Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter
2. Type `python3 --version` and press Enter
3. If you see something like `Python 3.8.0` or higher, you're good!
4. If you get an error, go to **Step 2**

### Step 2: Install Python (if not installed)

#### On Windows:
1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python version (3.8 or higher)
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Restart your command prompt and verify with `python --version`

#### On Mac:
**Option 1 - Using Homebrew (Recommended):**
1. Install Homebrew first by pasting this in Terminal:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Python:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

**Option 2 - Direct Download:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python version for macOS
3. Run the installer
4. Verify with `python3 --version`

### Step 3: Download the Project

#### Option 1 - Using Git (if you have it):
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fly-senga-ai
```

#### Option 2 - Download ZIP:
1. Download the project as a ZIP file
2. Extract it to a folder of your choice
3. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
4. Navigate to the folder:

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\your\fly-senga-ai
```

**Mac:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/fly-senga-ai
```

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps this project's dependencies separate from your system Python.

#### On Windows:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your command line.

#### On Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### Step 5: Install Project Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated:

#### On Windows:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### On Mac:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will download and install all the necessary packages. It might take a few minutes.

### Step 6: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   
   **Mac:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file:**
   
   Open the `.env` file in any text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac) and fill in your credentials:
   
   ```env
   QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_url_here
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   EMBEDDINGS=your_embedding_model_here (openclip or openai)
   ```

### Step 7: Run the Application

Now you can start the server:

#### On Windows:
```cmd
cd app
fastapi dev main.py
```

#### On Mac:
```bash
cd app
fastapi dev main.py
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/path/to/your/project']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [12345] using WatchedFiles
INFO:     Started server process [8856]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete. (After this line appears you can access the API at http://localhost:8000)
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** Your API is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 8: Test Your Installation

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. You should see the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)

## Using the API

### Initialize the Database

Before uploading any data, initialize the Qdrant collection:

**Using curl (if available):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/initialize"
```

**Using the web interface:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`
2. Find the `POST /api/initialize` endpoint
3. Click "Try it out" then "Execute"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Python not found" error:**
- Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
- On Mac, try `python3` instead of `python`

**2. "Permission denied" errors:**
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)`)
- On Mac, you might need `sudo` for some installations

**3. "Module not found" errors:**
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated
- Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**4. "Connection error" when testing:**
- Check your .env file has correct API keys
- Verify Qdrant is running and accessible
- Check your internet connection

**5. Port already in use:**
- Another application might be using port 8000
- Stop other applications or change the port in the command


## Stopping the Application

To stop the API server:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

To deactivate the virtual environment:

**Windows:**
```cmd
deactivate
```

**Mac:**
```bash
deactivate
```
